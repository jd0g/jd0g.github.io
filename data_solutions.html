								<h3>Controlling analytics expenses is mandatory</h3>
								<p>
									I am skilled at making more with less and have a reputation for building sophisticated solutions on embarrassingly small budgets
									with Kubernetes and Helm.  I also bring that frugality to cloud technologies, where a laissez-faire attitude can lead to a black hole in the budget.
								</p>
								<p>
									Operating on a shoestring budget and looking at Azure data solutions with fuzzy cost modeling,
									I instead settled on an on-premises Kubernetes cluster running a battery of data tools and environments.
									Here are some conclusions after about a year of road time:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The learning curve for Kubernetes is steep, and the up-front cost for this skillset is considerable.</li>
									<li>This is an incredibly low-cost yet elegant option for internal projects, but  for external customers, it might get dicey and would require some serious ITS expertise.</li>
									<li>The total cost to run this environment is nearly zero (!!) but one must consider on-prem maintenance costs for ITS resources.</li>
									<li>Each tool added to the arsenal must be independently configured with Helm.  A good understanding of security concerns around open-source helm resources is essential.</li>
									<li>Working with Kubernetes results in a very high understanding of each tool instantiated and the inner workings.  Other expensive turnkey solutions can be opaque and not well understood.</li>
									<li>Data processing and movement costs are eliminated for on-prem k8s, which eradicates what is commonly the greatest expense in cloud environments.</li>
									<li style="color:red">On-prem adds surprising elegance and maintainability for internal analytics efforts where budgets are tight.</li>

										<h3>Data Chaos</h3>
										<p>
											Anyone in analytics has experienced needing to calculate a metric only to find out others have done the same thing, but not the same way.
											A good solution design strives to define measures in a homogenous way across the organization, eliminating user confusion caused by measure inconsistencies.
											Here are some strategies I've used to accomplish this:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Clear and easily accessible end-user documentation including measures definitions and data source identification</li>
											<li>Standardized processes for validating data calculations and supporting systems</li>
											<li>Dimensional backends which allow measures to be naturally aggregated with no need for further calculations</li>
											<li>Least privileged data access controls, defaulting to no access</li>
											<li>Connections and communication with all groups and individuals involved in data presentation work</li>
											<li> Built-in usage monitors and audit capabilities at the user level</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Protecting Valuable Assets</h3>
										<p>
											I've heard that its not a matter of <i>if</i> an organization's data is comprimised, but <i>when</i>.
											It has probably already happened, and no one even knew about it.
											Ensuring multiple levels of data security is essential to protect the organization against malicious attacks.
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Data at rest must be encrypted.  If someone gets ahold of it, the effort to decrypt it is often enough to thwart malicious intent.</li>
											<li>
												Data in motion must be encrypted.  It is easy to let databases do whatever they do by default, but a solid encryption plan is ESSENTIAL, especially when the data is in the cloud.  We often assume the cloud provider's security efforts are enough.  That is dead wrong.
											</li>
											<li>
												Audit and classify data.  This step will make it easier to encrypt the most sensitive data fields
												and can help if performance becomes an issue with a comprehensive encryption strategy.
												Nevertheless, it is good to keep track of sensitive data and what users do with it.
											</li>
